# kolist_from_text
This script parses a text file with a "copy paste" list of KO numbers from a specific KEGG BRITE database entry into a list of only the numbers separated by commas.


## EXAMPLE

1. Access the KEGG BRITE page for the CRISPR-Cas system [here](https://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/get_htext#C17). 
2. Un collapse all the tabs and copy paste the entire list of KO numbers to a text file. Make sure that you are using plain text (you can do so in TextEdit for example by going to the Menu Bar > Format > Make Plain Text)
3. Save the text file.
